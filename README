DESCRIPTION
    This tiles windows in different ways.

METHODS
  new
  init
  start
    $self->start();

    Start the event loop.

Handlers
  observe_window_movement
    A FVWM::Tracker::WindowList observer, which tracks window movement (so
    we can see if the window has changed desks/pages).

  observe_window_addition
    A FVWM::Tracker::WindowList observer, which tracks new windows

  observe_window_deletion
    A FVWM::Tracker::WindowList observer, which tracks window destruction.

  observe_window_iconify
    A FVWM::Tracker::WindowList observer, which tracks window iconify.

  observe_window_deiconify
    A FVWM::Tracker::WindowList observer, which tracks window deiconify.

  observe_page_change
    Respond to a page or desk-change event.

  handle_focus_event
    Respond to a focus window event.

  handle_command
    Respond to a command (SendToModule,M_STRING event)

Helper methods
  set_transaction
    Set "transaction" on or off; this will temporarily disable some handlers
    since we don't want to react to things that we ourselves caused.

  move_window_group
    Move the given window to the next or previous group on this page.

  apply_tiling
    Apply the requested tiling layout.

    None Full

    Additional layouts are provided by layout plugins.

  manage_window
    A new or newly visible window needs to be managed.

  demanage_window
    A destroyed or newly invisible window needs to be de-managed.

  init_new_page
    Initialize page information for the current page.

  check_interest
    Look at the properties of the given window to see if we are interested
    in it. We aren't interested in SKIP_PAGER, SKIP_TASKBAR, DOCK or
    Withdrawn windows. We also aren't interested in transient windows.

    Also, we may not be interested in windows of certain classes or names.

    $res = $self->check_interest(window=>$id, tracker=>$tracker);

    $res = $self->check_interest(window=>$id, event=>$event);

  dump_properties
    Dump the properties of the given window.

  get_page_windows
    Get the windows on the given page.

REQUIRES
        FVWM::Module
        Class::Base

INSTALLATION
    To install this module, run the following commands:

        perl Build.PL
        ./Build
        ./Build test
        ./Build install

    Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the
    "./" notation, you can do this:

       perl Build.PL
       perl Build
       perl Build test
       perl Build install

    In order to install somewhere other than the default, such as in a
    directory under your home directory, like "/home/fred/perl" go

       perl Build.PL --install_base /home/fred/perl

    as the first step instead.

    This will install the files underneath /home/fred/perl.

    You will then need to make sure that you alter the PERL5LIB variable to
    find the modules.

    Therefore you will need to change the PERL5LIB variable to add
    /home/fred/perl/lib

            PERL5LIB=/home/fred/perl/lib:${PERL5LIB}
